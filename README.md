# rp2040-motor-controller

## Note: This is a from the upstream Twisted-Fields/rp2040-motor-controller repo.

### Intro / First Level Why ? 

Well, I find this very interesting / funny. 

The previous EMFcamps I have attended, I have always tried to "Make something that moved humans". 

One of them was a giant DC Wheelchair powered Creeper, 

One of them was Wheelchair Gokart. 

The most recent was a Brushless Hoverboard Kart / Trike. 

In all of these cases, the motor controllers have let me down. 


So this is my current working directory for making my own "Flavour" of Brushless Motor Controller.

### Second Level Why ? 

Well, Brushless motor controllers are Expensive. Theres things like the VESC, ODrive and the cheap red 300W Aliexpress controllers. 

The Ali Express controlers I have had go bang. 

The ODrive controllers are *Way* too expensive, and now, sadly, closed source. (Little bit salty about that)

Honestly, the smart move would probably be : Just buy Aliexpress cloned odrive boards. 
But then I dont learn anything. 

Anyway, All the changes here are under the same CERN Permissive as upstream. 

*Our dream is that you will fab your own boards, make changes, and share your work - giving this design life beyond our efforts.* - So I hope this plays nice with that. 

More info to come when I start hacking about a bit more.
